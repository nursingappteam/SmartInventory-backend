# Hello SQLite!

This project includes a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) server script that uses a persistent [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database. The app also includes a front-end with two web pages that connect to the database using the API. 📊

The home page asks the user to choose an option and presents the results in a chart. The admin page presents the log of past choices and allows the user to clear it by supplying their admin key (you can set this up by following the __Next steps__). 🔒

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### The back end

← `server.js`: The Node.js server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end. This API processes requests, manipulates the data in the database, and sends info back to the client (the web page built using the Handlebars files in `src/pages`).


When the app runs Glitch builds the database:

← `themedata.db`: Your database is created by `server.js` and placed in the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console by selecting __Tools__ >  __Logs__.

← `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

← `.env`: The environment is cleared when you initially remix the project, but you will add a new env variable when you follow the __Next steps__ to `POST` some data.

### The front end

← `public/style.css`: The style rules that define the site appearance. These include class rules that will be applied when the user selects a theme, with the `hbs` page writing the chosen classes into the page.

← `src/pages`: The handlebars files that make up the site front-end. The API in `server.js` sends data to these to update the UI.

← `src/pages/index.hbs`: The site homepage presents a form when the user first visits. When the visitor submits a preference through the form, the app calls the `POST` endpount `/pick`, passing the user selection. The `server.js` endpoint updates the database and returns the user choices submitted so far, which the page presents in a chart (using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/)–you can see the code in the page `head`);

← `src/pages/admin.hbs`: The admin page presents a table displaying the log of most recent picks. You can clear the list by setting up your admin key in __Next steps__ below. If the user attempts to clear the list without a valid key, the page will just present the log again.

← `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

## Next steps

The site __Admin__ page allows the user to clear the database log of picks–but only if a valid key is provided. This is a simplified example of auth that checks if the user entered key matches the one in the `.env`.

To set your app up to allow clearing the log:

* In your `.env` file, find the variable named `ADMIN_KEY` and give it a text string as a value.
* With the __Admin__ page open in the preview, enter the same value and hit the __Clear__ button–this time it should allow you to clear the log.

See the `clearLogs` endpoint in `server.js` to learn how this works.
